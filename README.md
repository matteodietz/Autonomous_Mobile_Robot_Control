## Project 1: Designing Nav2 Controller and Planner Plugins

Goal of this project was to let a turtlebot navigate along multiple waypoints in an environment with obstacles. To achieve this, we designed Nav2 controller and planner plugins. We aimed to improve a generic pure pursuit controller using various heuristics. Using this controller, a robot should follow a path found by an A* planner and smoothened by a Savitsky-Golay algorithm in both a virtual and a physical environment.
